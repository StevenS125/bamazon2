##### Bamazon Customer View
***

The Bamazon customer view allows users to see the items currently offered for sale. The user is first prompted to enter the item id# and after a valid one is selected they will be prompted with the amount they would like to purchase. If the item has enough stock the order will be placed and the total amount will be displayed as a receipt of what they purchased.
